# Create a tip calculator app
- Create a tip calculator app by building the layout first and then implementing the logic to calculate the tip from the user input.
- Learn about new UI components, such as editable text fields, radio buttons, and switches to build up the layout for your tip calculator app. Instead of using the Layout Editor in Android Studio, you’ll be editing the layout for your app in XML.
- Learn how to write Kotlin code to interact with the UI elements in the tip calculator app, so that you can calculate the tip. You’ll also learn how to handle edge cases in your app to make your app more robust.
- Add visual polish to the Tip Calculator app to create a better user experience.
